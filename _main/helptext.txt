I am an AI bot making use of the famous chatGPT

Here are some commands you can use:

/help   -> this help screen
/yardim -> Türkçe yardım ekranı
/new    -> type this to clean my memory about previous chats with you
/bot    -> see the current available bot types and their languages
/bot #  -> select a new bot to talk to (this also cleans my previous chats)

/weather city -> get weather information of a city

/image  -> when you type this, I will try to generate a picture about what we talked before

/image prompt1 prompt2 ..... -> I will generate an image depending on your prompts

Example:  /image a beautiful sunset in istanbul, bosphorus

/image --st##  -> works like the image command, but you can increase quality. (max:25)

Example:  /image a beautiful sunset in istanbul, bosphorus --st25

You can just type anything to talk to me.

Also you can send me voice messages, if you want a voice answer from me.
